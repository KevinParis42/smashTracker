# Express-Sequelize-React-Boilerplate
Simple boilerplate for creating web apps with Express, Sequelize for PostgreSQL DB and React

Use ```npm run start``` in client or server folder to launch servers

You can use ```npm run dev``` in the server folder to use nodemon


While client will be launched on port 3000, you will have to create a .env in the server folder, add ```PORT=``` then add the port you want your server to run on

Don't forget to delete the ```.gitignore``` inside the models, services and controllers folder, else, you wont be capable to push your work located inside those folders
